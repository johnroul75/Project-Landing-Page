This is my second project called "Landing Page". My new skills are some flexbox and css skills. I will be adding my input as I progress through this project.

As I progress with this project I realize that my code would not pass job quality. I base this off simple intuition. I hope the quality of my code and my understanding of flexbox increases as I progress as a developer.

COMPLETED PROJECT NOTES:

Upon completed my project here are some key points that have come to my realization: First, I am learning. I am able to do something I was not able to before. However, I can make things look right. I am not able to use flexbox 100% for this project. I can make things happen using absolute units. Finally, there are some areas where I could not match the positioning the exact same as the model we were provided. I am happy with how this project turned out considering where I started.
