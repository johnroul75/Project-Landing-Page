This is my second project called "Landing Page". My new skills are some flexbox and css skills. I will be adding my input as I progress through this project.

As I progress with this project I realize that my code would not pass job quality. I base this off simple intuition. I hope the quality of my code and my understanding of flexbox increases as I progress as a developer.
